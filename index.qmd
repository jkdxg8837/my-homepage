I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Warwick, advised by Prof. Hongkai Wen. My current research interests focus on the transfer learning of diffusion models.

I received my Master's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and my Bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT).
